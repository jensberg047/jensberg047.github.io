I am an Assistant Professor of **[Mathematics](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-arts-sciences/academic-departments-programs/mathematics)** at **[Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/)**.

In 2016-19 I was an RTG Lovett Instructor at Rice University. I received my PhD in 2016 from the University of Texas at Austin and my B.S. in Mathematics from UIUC in 2010.  I grew up in Chicago, Illinois.
  
My research interests lie at the intersection of number theory and geometry. Visit my **[scholarship](research.html)** page for more information about the flavor of questions I like to think about.
