      "description": "I am an Assistant Professor of **[Mathematics](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-arts-sciences/academic-departments-programs/mathematics)** at **[Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/)**.\n\nIn 2016-19 I was an RTG Lovett Instructor at Rice University. I received my PhD in 2016 from the University of Texas at Austin and my B.S. in Mathematics from UIUC in 2010.  I grew up in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nMy research interests lie at the intersection of number theory and geometry. Visit my **[scholarship](research.html)** page for more information about the flavor of questions I like to think about.\n",

For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n\nsummary(cars)\n\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n\nIncluding Plots\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n\n\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\n\n\n",
